    "Anyone can create a node, which has its own issuance of time. Every hour every node can create a new token, and each balance of tokens is exponentially discounted as clock time progresses. Nodes can indicate they trust other nodes, by which they indicate that they will accept tokens from a trusted node to be swapped 1-for-1 with their own tokens. This creates fungeability for the tokens of nodes between which a path of mutual-trust connections exists. "
